Air pollution is a growing concern worldwide and affects human health, ecosystems, and climate. Air quality prediction is an efficient tool for mitigating risks and decision-making. Traditional statistical models often struggle to capture complex, nonlinear relationships in air quality data. This project is going to design a hybrid approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory neural networks with Fuzzy Logic Systems for better air quality forecasting accuracy.
